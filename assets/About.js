I&#39;m a multidisciplinary chameleon currently located in New York City. I wear many hats such as consultant, writer, content creator, and media coordinator. In a past life, I was a software developer with over 4 years of experience in the agency world and swam within large e-commerce projects to leading small teams in an effort to educate the world on <a href="https://www.savethefood.com" target="_blank">food waste</a>. </p><h3>Less Professional About Me</h3><p> I am a native Brooklynite with a passion for whiskey, writing and enjoying late night live music. I am a community cat caretaker, TNR certified and love to travel, especially solo-travel. I am also a huge fan of spreadsheets and enjoy looking at people&#39;s organization of things. (You got a cool spreadsheet? Show me it and I will be excited with you.) </p><h3>For more information:</h3><ul><li><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiacalderone/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li><li><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i><a href="mailto:sophiacalderone@gmail.com?subject= Hi there" target="_blank">Contact Me</a></li></ul></div>',1),c={class:"about-photo"},d=["src"],u=a({setup(h){return(p,f)=>(s(),o("div",r,[l,e("div",c,[e("img",{class:"profile-pic",src:t(n),alt:"Sophia Calderone Profile Picture"},null,8,d)])]))}});export{u as default};
