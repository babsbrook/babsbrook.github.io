The videos were split into two sets. In the first set, our client wanted more than just the &quot;in-studio&quot; footage so I concepted four varying ideas utilizing the available studio space to help differentiate each song that would also be accompanied by b-roll and decisive lighting. The second set of three songs featured a &quot;live-performance&quot; vibe. During production, I helped with setup, camera placement and breakdown of equipment, filming some b-roll and take photos, acting as camera operator and working with talent and staff to ensure communication. Post-production, I worked closely during the editing process to determine the best shots from the footage. </p></section><section data-v-483280cf><h3 data-v-483280cf>First Set</h3><h4 data-v-483280cf>Pre-Production:</h4><p data-v-483280cf> The first set included four songs. They were to be done in the studio with each video varying in concept. Prior to production, I had already visited the studio so my main task was to come up with four varying concepts that could be possible within the 8 hours of studio time the client had booked. For the first song \u201CThis Is It\u201D, I assembled a document including other video inspiration, summary of approach, and a loose storyboard utilizing Canva so the client could gather an idea of what I had in mind and also gain insight into how I would be approaching the songs. </p><br data-v-483280cf><p data-v-483280cf> For the other three songs, I sent suggestions for mood and visuals within the available studio space and outside area. We would use our own team\u2019s lighting to add color which to aid in differentiation for each video. </p><br data-v-483280cf></section><section data-v-483280cf><h4 data-v-483280cf>Production:</h4><p data-v-483280cf> On production day, we utilized the studio room and sections of the studio\u2019s building to pair each song up with it\u2019s own imagery. Each song had it\u2019s own section of the studio room, dedicated space in the building for takes and differential colors for lighting. I worked closely with the studio staff and directed them, our videography team and the talent to ensure all four songs would have several takes and be completed within the day. Due to time constraints, we alternated settings to gather footage while the staff made changes in the studio. In between shots, I would also try to capture behind the scenes footage as additional material to be used during the editing process. </p></section><section data-v-483280cf><h4 data-v-483280cf>Post-Production:</h4><p data-v-483280cf> I oversaw the editing process with my teammate who handled the direct usage of the software. Editing generally spanned three days per video, including footage organization, project file setup and completion of the rough cut before some fine tuning. The client would make one round of suggested edits before we update and send them the final version. During this process I would occasionally act as client liaison, working with the client on timelines and giving them updates on the process of the video. </p></section>",4),g=t(()=>e("div",{class:"video-container"},[e("iframe",{class:"video",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQ45rgPAAPU",title:"",frameborder:"0",width:"100%",height:"100%",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:""})],-1)),m=t(()=>e("div",{class:"video-container"},[e("iframe",{class:"video",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffqgBR_K_7w",title:"",frameborder:"0",width:"100%",height:"100%",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:""})],-1)),w=t(()=>e("section",null,[e("h3",null,"Second Set"),e("h4",null,"Production:"),e("p",null,' The second set included three songs that would be released on the client\u2019s YouTube page as promotional material.
